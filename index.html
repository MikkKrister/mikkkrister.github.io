<h1>Liquid piston engine</h1>
<p>A liquid piston engine is a new style of combustion engine, that is similar to a wankel rotary engine, but the shape of the rotor and the chamber are inverted. It's made by a company called LiquidPiston and is an engineering marvel for anyone who likes traditional rotary engines. It's not currently in use in any car, but some small aircrafts and drones use this technology.</p>
